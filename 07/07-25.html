  <title>07-25 - Loading jQuery from a CDN</title>
</head>
<body>

  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>

  <script>
    window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js-external/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"><\/script>')
  </script>

</body>
</html>

<!--Line #9 is a protocol relative URL-->
<!--If the user is looking at the current page through https, then they will not see an error that tells them there are unsecure items on the page.-->
<!--The second script tag contains a logical operator, which checks to see if jQuery has loaded.-->
<!--If it exists, then a truthy value is returned and the logical operator short circuits.-->
<!--If it has not loaded, the browser tries to load the jQuery script from the same server as the rest of the website.-->
<!--The document.write() method is used to add a new script tag into the page.-->

<!--WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?-->
<!--The fallback option is important because the CDN may be unavailable, the file may have moved, and some countries ban domain names (such as Google).-->

<!--WHY ARE SCRIPTS PLACED BEFORE THE CLOSING </body> TAG?-->
<!--The script is not blocking other things from downloading.-->
<!--The DOM has already loaded by the time the script is executed.-->

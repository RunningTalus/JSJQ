FINDING ITEMS BY ORDER - each item returned by a jQuery selector is given an index number, which can be used to filter the selection.


NOTE: The jQuery object is sometimes referred to as being an array-like object because it assigns a number to each of the elements that is returned by a selector.


FINDING ELEMENTS BY INDEX NUMBER

.eq() - The element that matches the index number.

:lt() - Elements with an index less than the number specified.

:gt() - Elements with an index greater than the number specified.
